# A Neural Operator for Forecasting Carbon Monoxide Evolution in Cities

**Journal:** npj Clean Air

**Abstract:**
This study introduces a neural operator, CoNOAir, developed to model carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in urban environments. The performance of CoNOAir is evaluated against ground truth measurements, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting CO evolution in cities.
